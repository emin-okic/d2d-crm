# Introduction
In this article, I would like to start the discussion on UI design and starting up. The hope is that by reading this you can begin to understand how to design your own UI for the open source crm. 

Is UI design some magical ability that only a few of us can achieve?

Put another way, do you really need to be creative to create creative? 

As someone who comes from a hard math and computer science background, I have a hard time saying that this is true. Sure, I've taken plenty of art and design classes. Sure, I've spent some time drawing. But I would never consider myself an artist. I certainly wouldn't consider myself a good artist.

I am a firm believer that one does not need to be creative to generate creative UI design. I believe that done right, UI design is more of a testable science than we'd like to believe. 

Before I claim all of this on my own, please refer to John Caples's book Tested Advertising Methods for a easy start to your scientific advertising journey.

# What Is Good UI?
Let's start by defining what good UI is so we have a means of contrast. This might confuse you at first but good UI has nothing to do with creativity. Good UI design has one purpose. What is that purpose? Good UI serves to guide the user through the journey and the job being completed. 

So let's talk about the contacts page. A sales rep needs a place to easily view and organize their world of contacts whether it be prospects or customers. That means we need a way to view each contact and a centralized place to view multiple contacts. 

Then what makes this a good contacts page? Well if the sales rep gets value by each contact they can see and access, then a good UI design is something that enables sales reps to view as many contacts as clearly as possible. Any design decision that either lets the sales rep view more contacts, or find the contact they want faster, is a step in the right direction towards that goal.

So every page you design should by that definition have a goal. A way to deliver value to the customer. 

And any design decision you make towards that page should help you deliver more value to that customer.

Your color scheme doesn't matter, but when you think about what colors make people feel a certain way, then it matters towards the design of your page.

Your layout in general doesn't matter, but if changes to your layout help the customer achieve their goals faster, or to achieve more of their goals, then the layout does matter.
