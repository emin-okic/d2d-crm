## How to Turn Field Data Into Deals

**D2D CRM** is a free, open-source customer relationship management system built specifically for door-to-door sales reps using iOS 18 and above. It's designed to help reps manage prospects, track knocks, and follow up with leads â€” all while on the move.

## Why Build This?

A service is about helping someone â€” and in this case, helping sales reps do their job better.

What does that mean for a door-to-door rep?

- Managing leads while knocking doors
- Tracking prospects and their status
- Logging and reviewing knock history
- Saving time while improving follow-up

Thatâ€™s what this CRM aims to deliver.

## The 3 Core Services

### 1. Map Service

Every day starts with deciding where to go. A map helps reps:

- Find their next area
- See which homes were knocked before
- Log knocks directly from the map view

Itâ€™s the first and most important tool in the app. Without a map, itâ€™s impossible to organize territory or track progress.

### 2. Prospect Management

Once you talk to someone at the door, you need to remember the conversation.

This service allows reps to:

- Save addresses and contact names
- Add notes and follow-up details
- Keep track of every prospect over time

This is especially helpful for medium-difficulty leads â€” the ones that convert with just a bit more attention.

### 3. Backend Service (Data Glue)

To tie it all together, this CRM uses a backend data model to connect the Map and Prospect systems.

When you log a knock on the map, it shows up in the prospectâ€™s record. When you update a prospectâ€™s knock history, it affects how it appears on the map.

This structure creates a smooth user experience where everything works together without manual syncing.

## Why iOS Only?

Most reps use iPhones. Instead of trying to build for both platforms and doing a mediocre job, this project focuses on doing one platform well.

iOS also offers strong developer tools and a consistent environment for creating fast, reliable apps.

---

## Why Mobile Only?

Reps arenâ€™t at desks. Theyâ€™re outside.

That means software has to:

- Be quick to use
- Work offline
- Require minimal input
- Deliver fast feedback

This CRM is designed with mobile-first principles to support reps in the field, not slow them down.
