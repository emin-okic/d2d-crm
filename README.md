## Why D2D CRM?

Forget spreadsheets. Forget notebooks. Forget losing track of who to follow up with.  
D2D CRM is built for speed, clarity, and action:

- Tap a house on the map, log your outcome, and move on.
- Follow up later with one-tap scheduling.
- Record live conversations and get scored against proven sales responses.
- Track rejection streaks, conversion rates, and miles covered—all automatically.

No more bloated dashboards. No endless menus. Just the essentials, designed for your pace.

## Who It’s For

- Real estate agents tracking buyers and sellers across neighborhoods.
- Solar reps managing warm leads across counties.
- Home service pros who can’t afford to lose track of a single knock.
- Any sales rep who works in the field and wants a CRM that works there too.
