# D2D CRM

## D2D CRM Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, platform independent, open source CRM application for small businesses without tracking or forced cloud connection. To enable non-technical users to use the sync feature, a cloud service is provided optionally. If you like this project, please support the development by purchasing one of the in-app purchases in the App Store or via Github sponsoring.
