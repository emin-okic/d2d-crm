#  The Models Components
This project defines all the core objects that will be used to build the app.

## The Types Of Objects

### Key Value Item Model
The single item in a key value pair array. Gives more dimensions to an array which is nice sometimes.

### The Customer Model
The customer relationship management system only exists if customers exist.
Therefore, we define the customer most carefully.


### The Custom Field Object Model
// TODO Delete this in the near future. 
This is to give users the option to add a custom field to a customer.

### The Call Directory Number Object Model
TODO
