#  The Models Components
This project defines all the core objects that will be used to build the app.

## The Types Of Objects

### The Customer Calendar Object Model
This object depends on having a customer who can own the calendar events.

Every customer in the CRM could have calendar events associated with you.
That would be nice to have because then you could see customer interaction history.

### The Customer Appointment Object Model
TODO

### Key Value Item Model
The single item in a key value pair array. Gives more dimensions to an array which is nice sometimes.

### The Customer Model
The customer relationship management system only exists if customers exist.
Therefore, we define the customer most carefully.

### The Customer File Object Model
A customer can have files like emails or pictures associated with their account. 
There should be an easy way to save and manage prospect or customers files.

The max files a customer can have right now is 20 files, but this is easy to modify if needed.

### The Custom Field Object Model
// TODO Delete this in the near future. 
This is to give users the option to add a custom field to a customer.

### The Call Directory Number Object Model
TODO
